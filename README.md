# GStorm Factory Example

A sample Groovy script to show how one can create a simple factory class for a GStorm ORM connection.

This IS NOT anywhere near production code, or even elegant, but just a proof-of-concept. I don't even plan to make a library out of this or even maintain this script.

Also be aware that I am just learning Groovy, so there might be some Java-like coding in here, or even some really bogus programming patterns, so use at your own risk.

You have been warned, but feel free to use any of this code if you think it can be of use.
